            Identified key global economic trends to train a machine learning model for predicting the retail prices of coffee. Economic data considered will span from 1990 to 2018. The final model will attempt to predict the average global retail price for a pound of coffee.

          <p class="paragraph">Data was organized into six categories (Exports, Prices Paid to Growers, Precipitation, Temperature, Demand, and average price). The averages of these features were taken for each country and year. Weak linear correlations were used to determine future temperatures and preciptiation values for years past 2012. The accuracy of the models were looked at for both predicted weather values and known weather values.

          <h5 class="process_step">Economic Model</h5>
          <p class="paragraph">Data was organized into six categories (supply, demand, inventories, consumption, energy, ICO composite, and retail price). Each category of data was treated equally. 10 features were initially chosen from the data categories.
            A random forest regressor model was chosen over a linear regressor model for highest accuracy. Initial results provided promising scores (table A). The five least impactful features identified by the model. After exploring multiple combinations of features, the least impactful feature was removed for a total of nine features.
            The final model was trained with following results which can be found in table A. The model was then used to predict the average price of retail coffee bassed on the historic data used for training the model.
