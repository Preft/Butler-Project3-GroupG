# Objective:

Identify key global economic trends to train a machine learning model for predicting the retail prices of coffee. Economic data considered will span from 1990 to 2018. The final model will attempt to predict the average global retail price for a pound of coffee.

### Questions to answer:
1.	How has the production of coffee changed (increased, decreased) from 1990 to 2018?
2.	What are the top 10 coffee producing countries from 1990 thru 2018?
3.	Have exports from coffee producing countries increased or decreased between 1990 and 2018?
4.	Have imports for coffee increased or decreased between 1990 and 2018?
5.	How has the price for coffee beans changed between 1990 and 2018?
6.	Do energy prices impact coffee prices?
7.	Can a machine learning model be developed to predict trending coffee prices?


# Background:
The International Coffee Organization (ICO) is a United Nations agency representing the worldâ€™s major coffee producers. This organization was founded in 1963 with the signing of the International Coffee agreement. In addition to representing interests of coffee producing nations, the organization hosts publicly available global economic data regarding supply, export, import, inventory, and pricing. A key metric created by this organization is the ICO composite indicator price, which is considered the benchmark for global coffee prices. The organization also provides global coffee retail prices which will be averaged to determine the retail price for a pound of coffee.

# Data Sources
* [Kaggle: ICO Coffee Dataset (Worldwide)](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide)

Data was obtained from ICO Coffee Dataset (Worldwide) hosted on Kaggle. This collection contained 13 csv files capturing distinct metrics regarding coffee economic data. Scope of files evaluated were : global production, global imports, inventories, prices-paid to growers, domestic consumption, and  retail prices.

# Visualizations
Evaluated data was transformed into charts and interactive visualizations employing Tableau. Economic trends were identified from the visualizations and incorporated into designing a data structure for machine learning. Final visualizations were incorporated into the website and can also be located on the public Tableau website listed below in the references. Examples:

# Machine Learning

## Economic Model

![data_graphic.png](presentation/images/data_graphic.png)
* Eleven data sets were organized into six categories (supply, demand, inventories, consumption, energy, ICO composite, and retail price). The data sets were composed of metric categories partitioned by year and country. Categories were averaged (i.e. price) or summed (i.e. crop production) by year for each feature category to obtain global benchmarks for analysis. Each category of data was treated equally. 10 features were initially selected to train a machine learning model.

#### Top Features
![original_features.png](presentation/images/original_features.png) 

* A random forest regressor model (sklearn library) was chosen over a linear regression model bassed on accuracy. Optimization of the model was evaluated by removing features with low training scores (Table 1). After exploring multiple combinations of features three models were created. The first model contained nine-features with the least impactful one removed. The second model included the ICO Composite and the year. The final model contained ISO composite, year, and Brent annual average. The last two models will be considered for web deployment due to simplicity considerations. Graph C contrasts the nine-feature model predicted global retail price vs observed global retail price. The three models were saved in this repository.

## Environmental Model 

An additional model was also considered to determine ICO composite pricing bassed on environmental factors combined with supply & demand.

<b>Machine Learning (with linear regression)</b>
* The model attempts to take the average of a year for all features and predict the average retail price of the importing countries
* The model fails due to the fluctuations and adjustments of the market are  not accurately taken into account by the yearly averages. The linear coefficients are just a maginifications of the data we kept at the exspense of the fluctuations.


# Website
A website was developed to communicate the results of this project. The objective was to identify coffee production and consumption trends by employing data visualizations for creating a machine learning model.


# Conclusion
Predicting global coffee retail prices from public data is a challenging endeavor. Initial data collected from Kaggle contained transcription errors in some data sets. Supplementing the Kaggle data with the original data from the ICO had an impact on modeling performance.  Selecting data representing the process of coffee bean production, weather, exporting, importing, pricing, and consumption was critical to developing a model. Each data category or feature was reported by country and year. These features were summed or averaged by year to create a representation of a global process for each category. This enabled the direct comparison of diverse data sets. The global retail price was predicted with machine learning model bassed on the composite of these global process. The normalization process of data prevents prediction retail prices by country. This might be addressed in future models.

Linear regression and random forest regressor models were both evaluated for machine learning. The regressor model had training scores ranging from 0.92 to 0.96 depending on the number of features. The regressor model test scores had a corresponding range of 0.83 to 0.93.  The discrepancies between training and testing scores may imply overfitting of the model. This model also considered factors related to total global coffee bean production as a funciton of environmental factors influencing crop production. Harmonic tuning was not applied to this model. This may have increased the test scores.

The economic model was developed into an application that can be accessed via the website associated with this project. The models selected were bassed on the minimum number of features to simplify user interaction. The first model predicts global retail coffee price bassed ICO composite price and year (training score = 0.949, Test score 0.871). The second model also includes the annual average price of brent crude (training score = 0.956, Test score 0.914). Brent crude was identified as a key feature impacting accuracy. The intent of this feature was to incorporate energy prices into the model.

Predicting coffee prices is a challenging endeavor with complex factors to consider. This exercise has demonstrated it is possible to predict retail coffee prices bassed on historical data. Given more time, a more dynamic could be developed to predict prices with greater accuracy.
