# Objective:

Identify key global economic trends to train a machine learning model for predicting the retail prices of coffee. Economic data considered will span from 1990 to 2018. The final model will attempt to predict the average global retail price for a pound of coffee.

### Questions to answer:
1.	How has the production of coffee changed (increased, decreased) from 1990 to 2018?
2.	What are the top 10 coffee producing countries from 1990 thru 2018?
3.	Have exports from coffee producing countries increased or decreased between 1990 and 2018?
4.	Have imports for coffee increased or decreased between 1990 and 2018?
5.	How has the price for coffee beans changed between 1990 and 2018?
6.	Do energy prices impact coffee prices?
7.	Can a machine learning model be developed to predict trending coffee prices?


# Background:
The International Coffee Organization (ICO) is a United Nations agency representing the worldâ€™s major coffee producers. This organization was founded in 1963 with the signing of the International Coffee agreement. In addition to representing interests of coffee producing nations, the organization hosts publicly available global economic data regarding supply, export, import, inventory, and pricing. A key metric created by this organization is the ICO composite indicator price, which is considered the benchmark for global coffee prices. The organization also provides global coffee retail prices which will be averaged to determine the retail price for a pound of coffee.

# Data Sources
* [Kaggle: ICO Coffee Dataset (Worldwide)](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide)

Data was obtained from ICO Coffee Dataset (Worldwide) hosted on Kaggle. This collection contained 13 csv files capturing distinct metrics regarding coffee economic data. Scope of files evaluated were : global production, global imports, inventories, prices-paid to growers, domestic consumption, and  retail prices.

# Visualizations
Data evaluated was transformed into charts and interactive visualizations employing Tableau. Economic trends were identified from the visualizations and incorporated into designing a data structure for machine learning. Final visualizations were incorporated into the website and can also be located on the public Tableau website listed below in the references. Examples:

# Machine Learning

## Economic Model

![data_graphic.png](images/data_graphic.png)
* Eleven data sets were organized into six categories (supply, demand, inventories, consumption, energy, ICO composite, and retail price). The data sets were composed of metric categories partitioned by year and country. Categories were averaged (i.e. Price) or summed (i.e. crop production) by year for each feature category to obtain global benchmarks for analysis. Each category of data was treated equally. 10 features were initially selected to train a machine learning model.

### Top Features
![original_features.png](images/original_features.png) 

* A random forest regressor model (sklearn library) was chosen over a linear regression, model bassed on having the highest accuracy. Optimization of the model was evaluated by removing features bassed on accuracy of model and training scores (Table 1). After exploring multiple combinations of features three models were created. The first model contained nine-features with the least impactful one removed. The second model included the ICO Composite and the year. The final model contained ISO composite, year, and Brent annual average. The last two models will be considered for web deployment due to simplicity considerations. Graph C contrasts the nine-feature model predicted global retail price vs observed global retail price. The three models were saved in this repository.

## Environmental Model 

An additional model was also considered to determine ICO composite pricing bassed on environmental factors (weather)

<b>Machine Learning (with clustering)</b>
*	Using the historical export, consumption and trading/stock data for each country we can determine whether the future price of coffee beans would increase or decrease by country.
*	If the future price of coffee is increasing in the exporting countries, will there be a future price increase for coffee in the importing countries.
*	And vice versa, if the future price of coffee is decreasing in the exporting countries, will there be a future price decrease for coffee in the importing countries.

Due to project constraints this model was not prosecuted. 


# Website
A website was developed to communicate the results of this project. The objective was to identify coffee production and consumption trends by employing data visualizations for creating a machine learning model.
