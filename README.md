# Objective:

Identify key global economic trends to train a machine learning model for predicting retail prices of coffee. Economic data considered will span from 1990 to 2018. The final model should be able to predict the average global retail price for a pound of coffe.

<b>Questions to answer:</b>
1.	How has the production of coffee changed (increased, decreased) from 1990 to 2018?
2.	What are the top 10 coffee producing countries from 1990 thru 2018?
3.	Have exports from coffee producing countries increased or decreased between 1990 and 2018?
4.	Have imports for coffee increased or decreased between 1990 and 2018?
5.	How has the price for coffee beans changed between 1990 and 2018?
6.	Can a machine learning model be developed to predict trending coffee prices?


# Background:
The International Coffe Organization (ICO) is a United Nations agency representing the worlds major coffee producers. This organization was founded in 1963 with the signing of the International Coffee agreement. In addition to representing interests of coffee producing nations, the organization hosts publicly available global economic data regarding supply, export, import, inventory, and pricing.  A key metric created by this organization is the ICO composite indicator price, which is considered the benchmark for global coffe prices. The site also includes global coffe retail prices which will be averaged to determine the retail price of a cup of coffe.

# Data Sources
* [Kaggle: ICO Coffee Dataset (Worldwide)](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide)

Data was obtained from ICO Coffee Dataset (Worldwide) hosted on Kaggle. This collection contained 13 csv files capturing distinct metrics regarding coffee economic data. Scope of files evaluated were : global production, global imports, inventories, prices-paid to growers, domestic consumption, and  retail prices.

* [International Coffee Organization: Historical Data on the Global Coffee Trade](http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp)

This is the original source data employed on the Kaggle site listed above. Provides additional detail regarding the data sets.

* [Macrotrends: Historic trends in Brent oil prices](https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart)

Historic data regaring Brent crude prices.

* [Macrotrends: Historic trends in WTI oil prices](https://www.macrotrends.net/2516/wti-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart)

Historic data regaring WTI crude prices.

# Visualizations
Data evaluated was transformed into charts and interactive visualizations employing Tableau. Final visualizations were incorporated into the website and can also be located on the public Tableau website listed below in the references. Examples:

# Machine Learning
*	Using the historical export, consumption and trading/stock data for each country we can determine whether the future price of coffee beans would increase or decrease by country.
*	If the future price of coffee is increasing in the exporting countries, will there be a future price increase for coffee in the importing countries.
*	And vice versa, if the future price of coffee is decreasing in the exporting countries, will there be a future price decrease for coffee in the importing countries.
# Website
A website was developed to communicate the results of this project. The objective was to identify coffee production and consumption trends by employing data visualizations for creating a machine learning model.
